# WeatherDashboardApp

# warning! This application was made in a span of 4 hours. Viewer Discretion is advised.

This application uses the openWeatherAPI to make calls and display basic weather conditions of a major city of the user's choosing

While the functions were not contructed in the most optimal way, they do what is needed of them. 

The functions:
# make calls to the api
# store values from the object that is recieved
# display the values in the designated areas of the application
# store past search results into the local storage
# Dynamically creates buttons for easy access to redisplay past object values

The front end of this application uses the bare minimum to organize the data values of each call

This appliction will be improved at a later time.
